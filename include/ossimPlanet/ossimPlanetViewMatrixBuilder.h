/**
 * The view matrix builder serves several purposes. It can be used to allow one to do free form manipulation of the scene
 * based on position and euler heading pitch roll orientation.  Also, one can use the class to "track" another node whether
 * you are a fixed point looking at a moving object or a moving object looking at another moving object or a moving object
 * looking at a fixed point or looking from a fixed point to a fixed point.  To support all these scenarios we have decomposed
 * the stages internally to build the matrix into self contained paramters where each can be adjusted by a maniopulator.
 * Tracking in the true since of the word is really done by the ossimPlanetManipulator which owns a ViewMatrixBuilder and listens
 * for changes in nodes that either we are looking from or looking to and adjusts the paramters of the view matrix accordingly.
 *
 *
 * Each parameter updates the matrix at it's defined stage.  The multiplication or building up the final view matrix is done  
 * in the following steps:
 * <pre>
 *  Step 1 - Compute a Lsr Matrix with the current "from" Lat lon height position and a composited orientation
 *           created based on the "from" Heading Pitch and Roll and the Relative Heading Pitch and Roll and relative flags.
 *  Step 2 - Apply the From displacement to the current oriented axis.  The from displacement will shift the
 *           "from" eye position to a displacement relative to the position and orientation of the matrix from Step 1.  Each
 *           X, Y, Z value in the displacement vector is multiplied by the axis of the rotational matrix and added to 
 *           the Step 1's origin defined by the from Lat lon height in world  X, Y, Z space.
 *  Step 3 - Calculate a look vector at this point based on the Look vector alignment.  The default alignment is
 *           to position the look direction along the positive Y-Axis.  We will use this vector for other calculations
 *           in later steps.
 *  Step 4 - Displacement along the look axis calculated in Step 3 a "from range" distance.
 *  Step 5 - If there is no "to" information set then we create a lookAt view matrix using OSG's make look at by using the 
 *           look vector calculated in Step 3.  If there is a look "to" information set then goto Step 8.
 *  Step 6 - If the "to" information is set then first redefine a look vector that looks along the axis to the point you
 *           are looking at.
 *  Step 7 - Now apply 2 displacments.  The "ToRange" is a convenient displacement that could be achieved by using just
 *           the z component of the to displacment. The "to range" is added to the Z component of the "to displacement".
 *           the displacement is then applied to the axis created by using the look vector calculated in Step 6 and the makeLookAt 
 *           utility supplied to us by OSG.  This will create an orientation axis and we display the current displaced eye point
 *           calculated in the from stage along the new axis.
 * Step 8 - Apply the final Attitude to allow one to look around.
 * </pre>
 *
 * How to use the view matrix builder.
 * 
 * - Free form manipulation where you are just wanting to move the eye around. the paramters typically used are the 
 *   "from Lat lon Height" and the from Heading pitch and roll.  The from Realtive flags should be set to ALL and the relative
 *   heading pitch roll and all other values should be zeroed out.  The to information should be invalidated and not set.
 * 
 * - fixed point. you can set the from information to a fixed location and allow yourself to spin around the fixed point
 *   by adjusting the from range and look axis and the from heading pitch and roll.  I would default the relative orientation to 0's 
 *   and the relative orientation flags to ALL.
 *
 * - fixed point to fixed point.  There are 2 ways to implement this type of situation.  The little bit harder one to setup
 *   is to use it all as a from point with a range displacement.  So you could orient the From HPR axis and do a negative
 *   range displacement along the look direction for the from orientation.  The easier to control and setup is to treat the point
 *   to point type implementation as a "from to" setting.  So we set the from position Lat Lon Height and the point you are looking
 *   at Lat Lon Height.  We then set the orientaiton information for the from axis to all 0 and relative to all.  This will use the 
 *   normal of the local tangent axis at the from position for the calculation of a "make look at".  This will also keep the horizon 
 *   level.
 *
 * - fixed point to a node.  Currently we only support orientation and positional lookups for nodes that are or contain a node of 
 *   type ossimPlanetPointModel or of type ossimPlanetLsrSpace.  We will later add some of OSG's position attitude models.  The 
 *   view matrix does not auto track but auto tracking is done outside the class (@see ossimPlanetManipulator). Since the node is
 *   the "to" node the orientation information is not used from the passed in node.  We only use the transform to get the global 
 *   position of the node in Lat Lon Height.  The from position is fixed and should use te set routines that do not take a from node.
 *   to keep the horizon pretty much level you can set the "from fixed point" orientation to all 0 for from HPR and from Relative HPR
 *   and make relative flags set to all relative.  This will use the normal to the tangent plane as the up axis used in the calculation 
 *   of the makeLookAt call.
 *
 * - node to fixed point. How the look to the fixed point is oriented will depend on the settings of the relative orientation flags.
 *   the from point is created from the nodes location and then the orientation is grabbed from the node.  We currently only support
 *   locating an ossimPlanetLsrSpace somewhere as a child of node and we also can detect ossimPlanetPointModel.  
 *   The orientation of the lsr space and the location of the point model is used to populate the from information.  
 *   The relative flags used will dtermine how the eye tilts when doing a lookat vector to the fixed point.  If you want it to 
 *   not allow the horizon to move but stay level then I would do a NOR ORIENTATION FLAG and the relative HPR values are actually
 *   used in the orientation and so giving them the value of all 0 should keep the horizon level.
 *
 * - node to node. Node to node is nothing different than the node to fixed point but in the ossimPlanetManipulator it just keeps
 *   tracking the "to" node.  The tilting that occurs depends on how you set up the from information orientation and relative 
 *   orientation and the relative orientation flags.
